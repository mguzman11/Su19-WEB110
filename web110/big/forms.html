            <h2 class="subheader">Forms</h2>
                <p>Have you ever been to a website and it had a space for you to input your name, email address, telephone number, etc.? Ever wondered where that information goes?  Well, let me tell you! This is called a form; yes, just like the old school sheet of paper you used to fill out for someone. This electronic form is usually constructed by a programming language like PHP, Java, or in the case of web design, HTML. (Puri). According to Maneet Puri, from usabilla.com, </p>

                    <blockquote>“ A web form is a medium that allows your visitors to get in contact with you and to send information, such as an order, a catalog request, or even a query, which is passed on to your database. On some websites, information that is submitted through web forms is transferred directly to the company e-mail.”</blockquote>

                <p>So that information you submit, generally goes to an email that someone typically manages.</p>

                <p>Forms come in all different formats on websites. Some may have text only fields, radio buttons that you can select, checkboxes, drop down menus, or even allow saved browser data to help you complete the form faster. Although, forms are not limited to those fields, some may even include hidden fields that you, as the user, cannot input any information, or it can even have a spot for you to upload a file. (Puri)</p>

                <p>Since forms provide information from the user to the company, it is very important that they are well constructed. Forms can be created in HTML and CSS. I will be focusing on constructing forms in HTML. The &lt;form&gt; element tag in HTML is a container tag for the form’s control tags, and dictates how the form is layed out. (w3c.org) This can be thought of in the same way a &lt;body&gt; element tag is the container tag for whatever is displayed on the website. The &lt;form&gt; elements then houses the field and  the input elements, which each have different attributes. In HTML5, new attributes were added, however, browser support may not exist across the board. Some of these new attributes include, autocomplete, autofocus, and multiple. (Penland) So when creating a form in HTML, be sure to check to see if the new attribute you are using is supported. </p>
                <p>Although creating a form in HTML can be daunting, there is vital information that can be captured in a good form. You need to be sure that the form being used makes sense to the user and is not asking for unnecessary information. Requesting information such as a phone number when a user is submitting a form requesting to be added to an email listserv may send the message that you are using their personal information for more than just adding them to an email listserv, and this can reflect poorly on the company. A well constructed from, makes sense to the user, is easy to fill out, and captures the necessary information needed by the company.</p>
